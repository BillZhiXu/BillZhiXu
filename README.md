## Hi, I’m Zhi Xu, but you can call me Bill! I’m a senior at Boston College, double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I’m really into exploring how AI can make a difference, especially in fields like healthcare and finance. When I’m not buried in code or research, you’ll probably find me playing video games or watching a baseball game. I’m excited about the next step in my journey as I apply to grad programs in AI!

## Hi, Iâ€™m Zhi Xu, but you can call me Bill! Iâ€™m a senior at Boston College, double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. Iâ€™m really into exploring how AI can make a difference, especially in fields like healthcare and finance. When Iâ€™m not buried in code or research, youâ€™ll probably find me playing video games or watching a baseball game. Iâ€™m excited about the next step in my journey as I apply to grad programs in AI!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: asd project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Diffusion model, deep learning in general
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: xuds@bc.edu
